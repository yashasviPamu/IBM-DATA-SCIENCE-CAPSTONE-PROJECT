# IBM-DATA-SCIENCE-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
The capstone project of the course Data Science course with Python By IBM

Project consists of finding an ideal location as per the customer's requirements like having a house which has a good asian restaurant along with a supermarket nearby or a house which has a swimming pool and is near to supermarket.

This was achieved by using data sets from four square API which provides us with real-time data sets of the houses and as well as the public amenities and helps us in sorting out for the required neighborhood and the place.

K-means clustering was used in order to obtain the optimum result from the data sets received from four square API.

The result of one of the request can be seen in the report.ppt file.
